            <p>In CSS, the float property is used to position an element to the left or right side of its container, </p>
        </section>
      <!--<div class="clear"></div> -->
        <p>allowing text and other inline content to wrap around it.</p> 
        
        <p>This property effectively removes the floated element from the normal document flow,</p> 
            although it still remains a part of the flow and influences the layout of surrounding content.</p>
        <div class="block right">Float</div>    
        <p>CSS padding is the space between the content of an element and its border. </p>
         <p>It provides internal spacing, allowing designers to control the distance between the content and 
            the border of an element.</p>
